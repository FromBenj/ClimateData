# ClimateData
### _Side project to play with Symfony UX Chart.js_

## What it is
Representation of the temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951-1980.
You can check the evolution of every country, every continent.

I am now trying to correctly represent and compare the average temperature evolution of each country.
